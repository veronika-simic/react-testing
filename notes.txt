React Testing Library
- not just a library, also opinionated
- test your software the way users use it not by internal implementation since code can change
- find elements by accessibility markers, not test IDs (this means that our software is accessibile)

React Testing Library vs Jest
RTL provides virtual DOM for tests while Jest is a test runner that finds tests, runs tests, determines whether tests fail or pass
RTL is part of create-react-app

test function 

render - creates virtual DOM for any JSX argument. This DOM can be accessed with screen global object
expect - assertion which causes the test to succed or fail. All assertions start with expect + expect argument + matcher
