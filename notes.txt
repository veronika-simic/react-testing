React Testing Library
- not just a library, also opinionated
- test your software the way users use it not by internal implementation since code can change
- find elements by accessibility markers, not test IDs (this means that our software is accessibile)

React Testing Library vs Jest
RTL provides virtual DOM for tests while Jest is a test runner that finds tests, runs tests, determines whether tests fail or pass
RTL is part of npx create-react-app

Run the tests with npm test which starts jest in watch mode. 

Test function syntax

test('renders learn react link', () => {
  render(<App />);
  const linkElement = screen.getByText(/learn react/i);
  expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});

render - creates virtual DOM for any JSX argument. In this case it's App.
This DOM can be accessed with screen global object.
expect - assertion which causes the test to succed or fail.
All assertions start with expect + expect argument + matcher

Assertions
- all start with expect which comes from Jest
- expect is an object that accepts an argument againts which assertion is made
- what type of assertion is done depends on the matcher which comes from Jest DOM. Matchers can have arguments
- jest-dom is installed with create-react-app 
- jest-dom is imported in src/setupTests.js and that way Matchers are available
- jest-dom gives us DOM based matchers
